        <p>"In my daily life, I wear multiple hats. I'm a dedicated professional working in a company, where I apply my expertise
             as a front-end developer. This role allows me to gain real-world experience and continually refine my skills.<br/><br/>
             Outside of work, I maintain a well-rounded lifestyle. I'm passionate about staying active and make time for sports
              and fitness. It not only keeps me in great shape but also helps me stay focused and energized.<br /><br/>
              In parallel, I'm pursuing a master's degree in Web Technology and Informatics Engineering at Universidade Aberta.
               This academic journey enriches my knowledge and keeps me at the forefront of the ever-evolving web technology landscape. Balancing work, sports, and education is a fulfilling challenge I embrace every day.</p>
